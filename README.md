# eleven-fragments
Saves small images of items which will be later used to verify images in eleven street archives

Working on Eleven project which involves a group of volunteers restoring the MMO 'Glitch' which died in 2012. 

As part of the QA team I am attempting to build a tool which will deduce the x,y and type of each item, simply by searching for these items on 
one of many street snaps taken by former players. This should save hours of tedious placing by hand.

However this tool needs to have small unique image fragments of each of the items that can be found on a street.
Streets have been created containin all the items I am interested in and are being used as data for this tool.
This tool loops through all the items on a street and allows the user to select/save a small fragment and then check that it is unique. 

This is my first attempt at Java - and so is a bit clumsy in places.
